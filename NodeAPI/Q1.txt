Question 1 answers:

1. Statelesness -  The server does not remember anything about previous requests 

2. HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol - used for transferring data between server and client via methods like GET,POST,PUT, DELETE etc

3. REST - Representational State Transfer - it is a type of api which uses HTTP for CRUD operations

4. SPA - Single Page Application - Loads a single HTML and just updates the content based on the requirement than loading entire page again, faster than the classical application

5. Classical Applications - Multi Page application- It loads new page for each action

To run the application:
npm start
http://localhost:9000/CreateUser/Akash/Devops/601 4th street/28 - for route Parameter
http://localhost:9000/CreateUser?Name=Hasini&Session=nodeJs&Address=Boston&Age=24 - for query String or Query parameter

and check the written file in userInfo.json
